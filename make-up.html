        <h3>The importance of make-up in women</h3>
        <p>Make-Up Makes You Look Better, This is the most obvious reasons why a lot of people find make-up important.</p>
        <p>Make-up can do a lot of wonderful things to our physical appearance. It can hide unwanted marks on a persons face, improve the skin tone and       highlight ones facial features.</p>
        <p>We use makeup to increase the external beauty of a person.</p>
        <h3>How to Apply make-up</h3>
        <p>Remove any old makeup. When you are applying makeup, it is necessary to start with a clean palette.</p>
        <p>Remove any makeup that you might have slept in, and wash off makeup from earlier on in the day.</p>
        <p>If you try to apply more makeup over the top of old makeup your end look will appear caked on and more unnatural than makeup put on a fresh face.</p>
        <p>You also need to cleanse any makeup residue to keep your skin from getting clogged and irritated.</p>
